I like coding. Coding is a hobby! 
Coding is fun, but complex. Hobbies are entertaining activities for people to do or play. 
Coding has a varieties of modules and packages for everyone, it allows you to do ANYTHING! Just code it!!!I hate coding. Coding is not a hobby! 
Coding is boring, but easy. Hobbies aren't entertaining activities for people to do or play.
